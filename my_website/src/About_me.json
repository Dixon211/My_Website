"first_p": "Hey there, thank you for visiting the site. I really appreciate you being here. I’m an IT professional that spent most of my Covid learning networking and cybersecurity. This helped me to get a job after coming back from teaching in China. I'm the type of person that fully throws themselves into any project and when I was working on my IT certs, I was studying all day every day especially when I got put on the graveyard shift.",
"second_p": "Eventually I got to a more normal schedule and took some time for myself, but as I was working on more systems, I was looking at ways to shave time down from my job and of course automation was at the forefront of my mind. I pitched it to my boss to automate our new computer setup. At this point I thought I could cobble together something with system images and a few scripts but kept running into problems especially with our computer management software.",
"third_p": "Finally, I had to face the truth, I needed control over the computer and chose to pick up Python. Since then, the project has been shot down by my bosses’ boss, but I kept with the coding. My journey has been learning algorithms, engaging with the Baltimore coding community, and starting to pick up other languages. At the time of writing, I love Python but have branched out into C++ for microcontrollers and JS/React for building this website. Focusing on learning the best tool for the job. I am fully self-taught with help here and there from my friends at Baltimore Code and Coffee. I think this journey has given me a unique perspective where if I see a problem I can tackle it with new tools and I'm not scared to get into the weeds or completely overhaul something that I found out is not optimal down the line. Overall, I am jumping into machine learning, neural networks, and web scraping as they interest me the most.",
"magic_p": "Outside of coding I would say I am a bit of the stereotypical nerd who socializes. One of my favorite hobbies is Magic: The Gathering. I have been playing since college and its always fun to build commander decks and see what cool stuff you can do. In my heart I am a combo player who likes to build engines that make people scratch there head. My current project has been breaking Jadzi, Oracle of Arcavios//Journey to the Oracle. I love seeing the evolution of the deck from landfall, to ramp/control, to now self-mill graveyard recursion with a commander everyone had written off and I have found allows for great flexibility with getting extra value from control spells and using out of the box thinking that protects my commander by obfuscation. I have had many a player ask me to run through how I kill them since it requires me bouncing my own lands for infinite mana with Journey to the Oracle, then flipping over to Jadzi, Oracle of Arcavios to spell cascade into threats or just infinitely recur them with mystic sanctuary bouncing.",
"vg_p":"Not surprisingly I am a fan of video games. Some of my favorites are Call of Duty, Endless Legend, Street Fighter, and tons of indie stuff. I was ranked in the top 5% for MW1 remake by points per match. I found this out from a friend who was looking up stats because he loved the pro scene. I am still in the top list of Heavy from TF2 even after years of not playing, and I am having a blast figuring out SF6 combos. I would call most of my playstyles anti-meta. I can seem to always find a way to counter what is the most popular strategy, minus truly broken stuff, in a way that doesn’t compromise against other niche ideas.",
"startrek_p": "Lastly, I am a big Star Trek nerd. I didn’t think it was that bad as I would just watch whenever I was job seeking or in my off time, but I have come to terms I am in deep. How deep you ask? I have seen Star Trek: Enterprise and was able to make the connection instantly to Star Trek Beyond. I love the tech and optimism for the future Star Trek has. Its so interesting seeing how it also tries to deal with the balance of human nature with the questions of scientific ethics like “Do more scientifically advanced races have the obligation to allow less scientifically advanced races to develop naturally, no matter the consequences?”",

"EF_desc": "I took a job sight unseen on the other side of the globe. While I have traveled a lot I thought it would be good to get away from home to see the rest of the world. I thoroughly enjoyed this job and was glad that I was able to teach adult students. It gave me time to really embrace the culture in a way that I don’t think my colleagues with the younger kids could. On the job I learned how to provide effective education to advanced students and students who were in their first English class. I quickly made a name for myself for being a teacher that was extremely patient and flexible. Who was able to work effectively with tough students.",
"FDA_desc": "I decided to turn my hobby of building computers into a career. I got my A+ and eventually my Net+ and spent a large amount of time studying how computers work in-depth, especially when I was placed on the graveyard shift. For 6 months I worked 4pm to 4:30am and spent 80% of that time studying everything from ports, wifi frequencies, services, components, security encryption, and anything else that I came across that seemed interesting. While the job was simple it allowed me to work with the systems I needed and time to work up the tech ladder.",
"Shipshape_desc": "My second contract ended with FDA after covid ended. I started to work with Shipshape at this time and had much more freedom than I had had at FDA. I was now working in AD and Azure/Entra AD, was able to bit off more advanced problems with networks, and really prove myself on-site with users.  I eventually hit a point of wanting even more control over the system and took up coding for simple job automation which has become a passion.",

"stock_bot_desc_1": "The stock bot was something I wanted to work on right after I had gotten used to simple web scraping. It was my first major use of an API as we are using the Robinhood API to pull the top 100 stocks from the platform and then store that data in a class that was supposed to buy when it moves up and then sell when the value goes down. While the program itself is solid I have been tweaking it and the algorithm to make the bot profitable.",
"stock_bot_desc_2": "The project has been great, and I have learned so much while doing it from algorithm implementation, working in Jupyter Notebooks, working on a team of 2 with GitHub. We are also currently working on implementing a small version of data suggestion by querying a LLM like ChatGPT to get recommendations for longer term stock trading and prediction. My current focus is on making a database for supply lines to feed into this LLM or possible a neural network with current events information that would be web scraped daily to see how these events could affect business and their stock prices."
